## Robbie
main
Robbie is a game about a tiny robot with peculiar features. One of his arms is a vacuum while the other looks like a swiss army knife! Robbie is handy when it comes to fixing computers and he's also small enough to get right in there where most people can't reach. Computers look quite different to tiny Robbie. In fact, Robbie the robot encounters all sorts of different obstacles such as fried and loose wires, exploded capacitors, or maybe even gremlins! (They're real!)

Come along with Robbie the Robot and make the tiny electronics world a cleaner, safer, and a more productive place.
