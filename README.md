## Robbie

Robbie is a game about a tiny robot with peculiar featurs. One of his arms is a vacuume and the other looks kind of like a swiss army knife! Robbie is handy when it comes to fixing computers. He's also small enough to get right in there where humans can't reach. Computers look quite different to tiny Robbie. In fact, Robbie the robot encounters all sorts of different obsticals such as fried wires, loose wires, exloded capacitors, or maybe even gremlins! (They're real!)

Come along with Robbie the Robot and make the tiny electronics world a cleaner, safer, and a more productive place.
