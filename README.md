## Robbie

Robbie is a game about a tiny robot with peculiar features. One of his arms is a vacuum and the other looks kind of like a swiss army knife! Robbie is handy when it comes to fixing computers. He's also small enough to get right in there where humans can't reach. Computers look quite different to tiny Robbie. In fact, Robbie the robot encounters all sorts of different obstacles such as fried wires, loose wires, exploded capacitors, or maybe even gremlins! (They're real!)

Come along with Robbie the Robot and make the tiny electronics world a cleaner, safer, and a more productive place.
